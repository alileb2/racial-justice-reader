### The Souls of Black Folk by W.E.B. Du Bois

*   **Summary:** Published in 1903, this seminal collection of essays articulates the concept of “double consciousness”—the sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. Du Bois examines the aftermath of Reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow, and the enduring spiritual and political strivings of Black Americans. The work is a cornerstone of African‑American intellectual history and a foundational text for understanding the psychological and social dimensions of racial oppression.
*   **Commentary:** Du Bois’s notion of double consciousness provides a powerful lens for analyzing the ethics of resistance. It reveals how systemic racism not only imposes material barriers but also distorts the inner life of the oppressed. Resistance, in this frame, must involve both an outward struggle against unjust structures and an inward struggle for self‑definition and psychic wholeness. The famous question “How does it feel to be a problem?” underscores the dehumanizing gaze that Black people are forced to navigate. Ethical resistance, therefore, requires reclaiming one’s own narrative and refusing to be defined by the dominant culture’s contempt. Du Bois’s emphasis on education, political agency, and cultural expression as tools of liberation remains profoundly relevant to contemporary movements that seek to affirm Black dignity and autonomy.
*   **Suggested Discussion Questions:**
    1.  How does the concept of “double consciousness” help us understand the psychological impact of racism, and what implications does it have for strategies of resistance?
    2.  Du Bois writes that “the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color‑line.” To what extent does this statement hold true in the twenty‑first century, and how might our understanding of the color‑line need to evolve?
    3.  In what ways does *The Souls of Black Folk* model an ethical approach to resistance that combines intellectual rigor, spiritual depth, and political commitment?
