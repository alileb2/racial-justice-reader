# Contributing to the Racial Justice Reader

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this living syllabus! This document outlines how you can participate in building this collaborative digital reader on **The Ethics of Resistance**.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. **Suggest a Reading**
The primary way to contribute is to propose a text, article, speech, film, or other resource for inclusion. To do this:

1. Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/alileb2/racial-justice-reader/issues) and click **New Issue**.
2. Select the template **📖 Suggest a New Reading**.
3. Fill out all the requested details:
   - Work details (title, author, link, type)
   - Relevance to the project (choose a module, provide a summary, explain its importance)
   - A short original commentary or analysis (150–300 words)

The editorial team will review your suggestion and, if approved, invite you to submit a Pull Request that adds the reading to the appropriate module.

### 2. **Submit a Pull Request**
If you are familiar with Git and GitHub, you may directly add a reading to one of the module files and open a Pull Request. Please follow these steps:

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Edit** the relevant module file (`Module_01_Historical_Foundations.md`, `Module_02_Key_Concepts.md`, or `Module_03_Contemporary_Voices.md`).
3. **Add your entry** using the format described at the top of each module.
4. **Commit** your changes and push to your fork.
5. **Open a Pull Request** that:
   - Clearly describes the addition
   - Links to any related issue (if you previously opened one)
   - Includes a brief note about why this reading belongs in the reader

### 3. **Improve Existing Content**
You can also help by:
- **Editing** existing entries for clarity, accuracy, or style.
- **Adding** discussion questions, cross‑references, or additional commentary.
- **Translating** entries into other languages (please open an issue to discuss first).

### 4. **Spread the Word**
Share this project with educators, activists, students, and anyone interested in racial justice and resistance. The more diverse the contributors, the richer the reader will become.

## Editorial Guidelines

To maintain the quality and coherence of the reader, all contributions should:

- **Align with the theme** of *The Ethics of Resistance*.
- **Be academically rigorous** while remaining accessible to a broad audience.
- **Respect the voices and experiences** of marginalized communities.
- **Include proper attribution** and, where possible, links to freely accessible versions of the work.
- **Adhere to the formatting conventions** outlined in each module.

The editorial team reserves the right to request revisions, merge edits, or decline contributions that do not meet these guidelines. All decisions will be made transparently and with the goal of building a resource that is both intellectually substantive and politically committed.

## Communication

- **Questions?** Open a [general issue](https://github.com/alileb2/racial-justice-reader/issues) with the label `question`.
- **Discussion about existing entries?** Comment directly on the relevant module file in a Pull Request or open an issue.
- **Want to join the editorial team?** Reach out via an issue describing your background and interest.

## Acknowledgments

Every contributor will be acknowledged in the repository’s [README](README.md) and in any formal releases (e.g., “Volume 1”) that result from this project.
